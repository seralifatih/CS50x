    <h3>Earyl Republic Era</h3>
    <body>
        <p>The power of the monarch passed to two annually
        elected magistrates called consuls. They also served
        as commanders in chief of the army. The magistrates,
        though elected by the people, were drawn largely from the
        Senate, which was dominated by the patricians, or the descendants
        of the original senators from the time of Romulus. Politics
        in the early republic was marked by the long struggle between
        patricians and plebeians (the common people), who eventually
        attained some political power through years of concessions from
        patricians, including their own political bodies, the tribunes,
        which could initiate or veto legislation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 450 B.C., the first Roman law code was inscribed on 12 bronze
        tablets–known as the Twelve Tables–and publicly displayed in the
        <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/roman-forum"
        target="_blank">Roman Forum</a>. These laws included issues of legal procedure, civil
        rights and property rights and provided the basis for all future Roman
        civil law. By around 300 B.C., real political power in Rome was centered
        in the Senate, which at the time included only members of patrician and
        wealthy plebeian families.</p>
