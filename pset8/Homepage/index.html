        <h3><b>Augustus</b></h3>
        <div class="body">
            Augustus’ rule restored morale in Rome after
        a century of discord and corruption and ushered
        in the famous pax Romana–two full centuries of peace
        and prosperity. He instituted various social reforms,
        won numerous military victories and allowed Roman
        literature, art, architecture and religion to flourish.
        Augustus ruled for 56 years, supported by his great army
        and by a growing cult of devotion to the emperor. When he
        died, the Senate elevated Augustus to the status of a god,
        beginning a long-running tradition of deification for popular
        emperors.
        </div>
        <h3><b>End of Julio-Claudian Dynasty</b></h3>
        <div class="body">
         Augustus’ dynasty included the unpopular Tiberius (14-37 A.D.),
        the bloodthirsty and unstable <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/caligula" target="_blank">
            Caligula</a> (37-41) and Claudius
        (41-54), who was best remembered for his army’s conquest of Britain.
        The line ended with <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/nero" target="_blank">Nero</a>
        (54-68), whose excesses drained the Roman treasury a
        nd led to his downfall and eventual suicide. Four emperors took the throne
        in the tumultuous year after Nero’s death; the fourth, Vespasian (69-79),
        and his successors, Titus and Domitian, were known as the Flavians; they
        attempted to temper the excesses of the Roman court, restore Senate authority
        and promote public welfare. Titus (79-81) earned his people’s devotion with
        his handling of recovery efforts after the infamous eruption of Vesuvius,
        which destroyed the towns of Herculaneum and <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/pompeii" target="_blank">Pompeii
        </a>. Check this <a href="julioclaudian.html">link</a> for a list of Julio-Cluadian Dynasty.

        <h3><b>Five Good Emperors</b></h3>
        <p>The reign of Nerva (96-98), who was selected by the Senate to succeed Domitian,
        began another golden age in Roman history, during which four emperors–Trajan,
        Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius–took the throne peacefully,
        succeeding one another by adoption, as opposed to hereditary succession. Trajan
        (98-117) expanded Rome’s borders to the greatest extent in history with victories
        over the kingdoms of Dacia (now northwestern Romania) and Parthia. His successor
        Hadrian (117-138) solidified the empire’s frontiers (famously building <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-rome/hadrians-wall"
        target="_blank">Hadrian's Wall</a> in present-day England) and continued his predecessor’s work of establishing
        internal stability and instituting administrative reforms. Under Antoninus Pius (138-161),
        Rome continued in peace and prosperity, but the reign of <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/marcus-aurelius"
        target="_blank">Marcus Aurelius</a> (161–180) was dominated by conflict, including war
        against Parthia and Armenia and the invasion of Germanic tribes from the north.
        When Marcus fell ill and died near the battlefield at Vindobona (Vienna), he broke
        with the tradition of non-hereditary succession and named his 19-year-old
        son Commodus as his successor.</p>
